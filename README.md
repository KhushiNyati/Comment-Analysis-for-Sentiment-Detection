Comment-Analysis-for-Sentiment-Detection
==============================
# **Comment Analysis for Sentiment Detection**  

##  Overview  
This project is designed to analyze user comments and determine their sentiment—whether **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, it processes textual data, extracts insights, and classifies sentiments effectively.  

##  Key Features  
- **Sentiment Classification** – Identifies and categorizes comments into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments.  
- **Text Preprocessing** – Cleans and prepares text data using **tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization**.  
- **Machine Learning Models** – Implements **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for sentiment detection.  
- **Deep Learning Approach** – Uses **LSTM and BERT** for advanced sentiment analysis.  
- **Data Visualization** – Generates **word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs, and heatmaps** for better insights.  
- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis** – Supports **live input processing** to analyze comments dynamically.  

##  Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language** – Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob  
- **Machine Learning** – Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
- **Deep Learning** – TensorFlow, PyTorch (for LSTM, BERT-based models)  
- **Data Visualization** – Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud  

##  How to Use  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhushiNyati/Comment-Analysis-for-Sentiment-Detection.git

cd Comment-Analysis-for-Sentiment-Detection

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the sentiment analysis script:

python sentiment_analysis.py

4️⃣ Input a comment and get sentiment classification results!

Applications
🔹 Social Media Monitoring – Analyze user opinions from Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.
🔹 Customer Feedback Analysis – Improve products/services by understanding customer sentiment.
🔹 Product Review Classification – Identify trends and insights from online reviews.
🔹 Hate Speech Detection – Flag and analyze offensive or inappropriate comments.

Future Enhancements
🔹 Real-time API Deployment for sentiment classification.
🔹 Multilingual Sentiment Analysis to support various languages.
🔹 Emotion Detection (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.) for deeper sentiment insights.
